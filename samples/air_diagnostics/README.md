## Sample code for AIR Diagnostics

To help in debugging and identifying problems, we have created a diagnostics mechansim that is built into the
AIR runtime and enabled via the use of an ANE. This sample demonstrates how to use this in order to detect
an error in the runtime and to pick up a relevant diagnostic log that is being generated due to the settings
provided to the Diagnostics ANE at start-up.

**Note** this requires version 51.1.3.7, or later, of the AIR runtime.
